# UC-Freeze
UC-Freeze is an unsupervised clustering tool for behavioral scoring in rhesus macaques, developed by Fox Lab at UC Davis.
The code currently runs on Python 3.8.3.
We encourage use of UC-Freeze and ask only that you refer to and cite this pre-print: [doi will go here, later].
The project is currently maintained by me, Dan Holley.
If you have questions about the project, please email me anytime: dholley@ucdavis.edu.
